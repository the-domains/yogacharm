description: "So this is me, Jane Lux! And I want to talk to you about yoga! The term yoga comes from the language Sanskrit used by the ancient people of India and of today as well. The literal translation in Sanskrit is union, specifically of the body, mind, and soul. Most of us have an understanding of the mind and body, but the soul? What is that? Does it exist? How do I know if I have one? How is it possible? I didn't have a clue what to think or how to comprehend uniting these miraculous things. My intention was simply to exercise. After months of consistent yoga practice I finally realized I had a soul and began to understand what it meant. I truly believe I reached enlightenment through the practice of yoga. My mind met my heart, my soul and my body. I felt the whole truth of my existence. Nirvana. Now my upbringing did not consist of any strict religious beliefs so I never felt the pressure to believe in any religion nor was I seeking enlightenment. However for as long as I can remember I was constantly wondering about the universe in relation to myself. I don't consider myself religious but I do consider myself spiritual. I never studied buddhism, hinduism, christianity, or judaism. Call it a miracle. Call it an accident. Somehow I reached a place that buddhist monks and hindus try to reach for lifetimes and lifetimes. A place that people have been seeking and yearning to understand for thousands of years. You can believe me or not. This is my testimony. This is my truth, and I simply must share it with you! "
